META-ARP
========
A Yocto/OpenEmbedded layer providing BSP for Automotive Reference Platform.

Maintained at https://github.com/pelagicore/meta-arp

Dependencies
------------

This layer depends on:
* poky (http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky)
* meta-openembedded (http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/)

Branching
---------
This repository will follow the yocto release system. Whenever a new yocto
release has been released, a new branch with the same name will be created from
the master branch.

All feature growth should happen first on the master branch,
but will also be cherry picked back to the latest yocto release branch.
Security and bug fixes will be evaluated case by case and backported as
necessary. The ambition is to actively maintain the two latest releases and/or
one year old releases in this fashion.
